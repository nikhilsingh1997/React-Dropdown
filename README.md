# Problem statement
Create an app to manage albums.


Features (No need for extra features, just make the listed features)
Fetch and show albums from the api - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums
Add an album, make a POST call to the above url (from where you are fetching) and save the album in react state. (This will be a dummy request, you wonâ€™t be able to add albums to the server. But the request is valid and will send you some data. Read the guide).
Update the album, make a PUT call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).
Delete an album, make a DELETE call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).
